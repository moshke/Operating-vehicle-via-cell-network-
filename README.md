based on  a AT89C5131 microcontroller and an LCD display to output information.
The code initializes the LCD and displays a welcome message, and then waits for a call to be received. When a call is received, the user is prompted to enter a code number, and the code reads the code number from a keypad. Depending on the code entered, the car will move in different directions or stop.
there are functions for controlling the LCD display, including lcd_config(), delay_lcd(), lcd_clr(), lcd_line(), lcd_display(), lcd_string(), send_command(), and send_data(). These functions handle initializing the LCD, clearing the display, setting the cursor to a particular line and position, displaying a character, displaying a string, sending a command to the LCD, and sending data to the LCD. also have several functions for controlling the motors of the phone car, including forward(), back(), yamin(), smual(), and stop(). These functions set the pins connected to the motor driver to control the direction of the motor, causing the car to move forward, backward, turn right, turn left, or stop. include two functions for reading the status of the keypad, including get_key1() and get_sh1(). These functions read the status of the keypad and return the pressed key or button.
